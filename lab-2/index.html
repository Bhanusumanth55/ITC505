    <h3>SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.</h3>
    
        <p><br><i>Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner</i><br></p>
    
    <article>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>If the great gods be just, they shall assist<br>The deeds of justest men.</p>
    <p><b>MENECRATES</b><br>Know, worthy Pompey,<br>That what they do delay, they not deny.</p>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays<br>The thing we sue for.</p>
    <p><b>MENECRATES</b><br>We, ignorant of ourselves,<br>Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers<br>Deny us for our good; so find we profit<br>By losing of our prayers.</p>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>I shall do well: The people love me, and the sea is mine;<br>My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope<br>Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony<br>In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make<br>No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where<br>He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,<br>Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,<br>Nor either cares for him.</p>
    <p><b>MENAS</b><br>Caesar and Lepidus<br>Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.</p>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>Where have you this? 'tis false.</p>
    <p><b>MENAS</b><br>From Silvius, sir.</p>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,<br>Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,<br>Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!<br>Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!<br>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,<br>Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks<br>Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;<br>That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour<br>Even till a Lethe'd dulness!</p>
    <p><i>Enter VARRIUS</i><br><b>VARRIUS</b><br>How now, Varrius!</p>
    <p><b>VARRIUS</b><br>This is most certain that I shall deliver:<br>Mark Antony is every hour in Rome<br>Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis<br>A space for further travel.</p>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>I could have given less matter<br>A better ear. Menas, I did not think<br>This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm<br>For such a petty war: his soldiership<br>Is twice the other twain: but let us rear<br>The higher our opinion, that our stirring<br>Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck<br>The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.</p>
    <p><b>MENAS</b><br>I cannot hope<br>Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:<br>His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;<br>His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,<br>Not moved by Antony.</p>
    <p><b>POMPEY</b><br>I know not, Menas,<br>How lesser enmities may give way to greater.<br>Were't not that we stand up against them all,<br>'Twere pregnant they should square between<br>themselves;<br>For they have entertained cause enough<br>To draw their swords: but how the fear of us<br>May cement their divisions and bind up<br>The petty difference, we yet not know.<br>Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands<br>Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.<br>Come, Menas.<br><i>Exeunt</i></p>

    <h3>Addendum</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I used HTML to make paper web page. HTML tags help me to organize parts of paper. I use |article| tag for main story and another for explain why I choose HTML parts. This help people to see why I make these decisions. It also look good for web because |article| tag is good for sections that stand alone.</li>
        <li>I put title and metadata in head to help browser know about my page. |body| has all content and |footer| at end to show last updated time. I used |table| for navigation links at top, this help to go other scenes of play. I used |tr| and |td| for table row and table data simultaneously. I used |a| to anchor and refer the links when needed. I used |p| for paragraphs and |b| to make some text bold that need stand out. Also I used |h3| for headings in the page. I had used |br| tag to break between the sentences. I used |i| to make any special words italic</li>
        <li>Also, I make sure links look blue and no underline unless hover because it clear to see and use. I no use too much style, only necessary because function more important than look for now.</li>
        <li> I updated the last modified script using |script| tag and made sure the script for last modified script is in footer using |footer| tag</li>
        <li>This way, I make sure everything needed is there and easy for read and grade.</li>
    </article>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</body>
